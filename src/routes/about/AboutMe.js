        I am a full stack software developer with 1 year of working experience in
        fields like frontend, backend, databases and APIs. I
        combine my interpersonal skills with technical skills and fully commit
        to consistency in meeting deadlines. I utilize all available resources and
        learn new technologies to achieve results. I enjoy creating beautiful, accessible, and
        responsive websites using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Angular, SCSS, Vanilla
        JavaScript, and React. Effective use of time, problem-solving and
        communication skills help me show a positive attitude in complex
        situations. I have passion for learning and my desire to learn quickly adapts me to changing
        situations.
